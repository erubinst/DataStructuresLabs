I affirm that I have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
The efficiency test where the new integers are put in at the beginning of the list will take a lot longer because every time a new integer is added to the list, the entire list has to be shifted.  In fact, the test will get slower and slower as the list gets bigger and more entries need to be shifted.  For the test memory test, the first run memory ended on the value 67100000.  The second run with more memory ended on 16770000.  The second run was quicker than the first run and prints out in chunks.
